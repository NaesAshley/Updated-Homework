if 0 display this dom ----------------------------------------------------------
google update - how to post img through js -- "how to update dom image with JS" --
variable to hold the status flip or not 0 vs 1; true or false
function to call when element is click -- function needs to check variable, if true then -- if else statement within the function -- if not display the other thing

maybe try an array that holds the image -- that will populate the grid

- method that goes along with arrays that randomize
- assign values associated with the grid
- check positions within the array
- if image is at indx 2 of array thats how i can check.

- reset function - . reload -- reloading the page may be easiest?
- player 1 and player 2 button score held in a variable with time.
