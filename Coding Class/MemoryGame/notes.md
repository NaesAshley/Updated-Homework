//////////////////display + flip

- all cells must have the back facing card card
- get images to display in cells
- create a flip function between two images within 1 cell; true/false or 1&2
- randomize the images across the cells

once complete

////////////////registering the computer to know
randomize so only 2 of the same image populates never 3,4, etc.
when user clicks if it matches - leave facing image

- if doesn't match turn back facing card
- continue until all cards are matched
- once matched

///////////////Timer
timer starts once "player 1/2" clicks, initiate count down
when game is complete, stop the timer.

- same timer per player - display
- show who wins based on who completes the fastest
